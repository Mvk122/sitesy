## Usage Specifics
* Markdown files stored in the generated `md` folder will get output as html files. 
* The HTML can be customised by creating custom tags in `templates` i.e `h1.jinja`, `p1.jinja`, the contents will be filled in at `{{ contents }}`
* Place reusable components in `components`, these can be referenced by other `jinja` files or in the markdown with the following syntax: 
```
---
{% include "header.jinja" %}
---
```
* Examples for the above are stored in `./demo`.
